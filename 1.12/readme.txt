== Description ==

**The Social Exchange Plugin** allows users to promote their posts and pages through a points-based system.

Users will be presented other posts / pages and they will get points by sharing those posts.

The points can be then assigned for the users own posts to be shared.

The system keeps the score by a services app located on our server.
