Get instant Facebook shares for your WordPress posts 

== Description ==


Do you dream of your content being shared? 

This is precisely what The Social Exchange Plugin helps you accomplish: **increase the number of Facebook Likes and Shares** of your posts and pages.

HOT: We run an Indiegogo campaign to collect funds for the 2.0 version of this plugin. More social networks(Twitter, Google, LinkedIn) are coming soon! [Support us now and be te first to use it!](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/moresharesforyou-content-sharing-on-autopilot/x/5156698) 

We help WordPress Users get more Likes and Shares through the Social Exchange - a points-based reciprocal system. It works like this:
* when you install the plugin we give you FREE points
* you spend your points giving them to people sharing your content
* you get more points by sharing others content.


IMPORTANT: You should display the Facebook LIKES button on your shared posts and pages so your audience can see on your website the number of Likes. (Facebook adds the likes and the shares into 1 single metric). This is an important social proof indicator for your readers.

It's a WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME to have a good website/blog that nobody is seeing or reading. The Social Exchange Plugin helps you achieve 2 goals:
1. distribute your content
2. show the world your content is liked (distributed).
